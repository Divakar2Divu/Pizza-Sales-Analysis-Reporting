Description:
Analyzed pizza sales data from a restaurant chain to uncover insights related to revenue, top-performing pizzas, customer order behavior, and peak business hours. Combined Python for data wrangling, SQL for querying, Excel for initial exploration, and Power BI for interactive dashboarding.
Key Contributions:

SQL: Queried sales data to extract order details, revenue by category, and customer ordering patterns.

Python: Used Pandas to clean and transform data (handling nulls, converting date/time formats) and Matplotlib to explore seasonal and hourly trends.

Excel: Conducted preliminary EDA and validation of data, created pivot tables for quick insights.

Power BI: Built a professional dashboard displaying:

Daily/weekly/monthly sales

Top 5 pizzas by revenue and quantity sold

Sales heatmap by hour of the day and day of the week

Category-wise (e.g., Veg, Non-Veg) performance analysis
Impact:

Identified peak hours (e.g., Friday evenings) and best-selling items (e.g., Pepperoni Pizza).

Provided actionable insights for inventory planning, staffing, and promotional campaigns.

Demonstrated end-to-end data analytics pipeline from raw data to business dashboard.
